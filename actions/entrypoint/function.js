If you ever need to run the checklist manually, you can type \`â€¦run sensory checklist posting to ${postChannels}\`.

Once you choose a room, you will be asked if each crop is a \`Pass\`, a \`Caution\`, a \`Fail\` or \`N/A\` if a sensory test wasn't performed.

Click a room when you are ready to provide scores.
